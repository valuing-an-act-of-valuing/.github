The things of nothing, Here's where we begin
The past and present, To be continued
Stepped up to each plus, Unknowingly
To be the same, one upon another

Write your name on the top
Tie the strings so tightly
Again and again, repeatedly
Decorate on white wall, to prepare to coming
The smells of a taste of the great song

Walk on the street to the red on top
with the rhythm for the good arm swinging
til the end of the next step by step
Don't be a shy to a first experience

We are in a room with a round table
Think about tall trees live near clearwater
Powerful, Energetic, Healthy, Unity
Pehu is a sign for pal up with you
